Lately I been I been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby I been I been prayin' hard
Said no morecounting dollars
We'll be counting stars
Yeah we'll be counting stars
I see this life Like a swinging vine
Swing my heart across the line
In my faces flashing signs
Seek it out and ye shall find
Old but I'm not that old
Young but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
I'm just doing what we're told
I feel something so right
At doing the wrong thing
I feel something so wrong
At doing the right thing
I couldn't lie couldn't lie couldn't lie
Everything that kills me
makes me feel alive
Lately I been I been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby I been I been prayin' hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars
Lately I been I been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby I been I been prayin' hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be we'll be counting stars
I feel the love And I feel it burn
Down this river every turn
Hope is a four letter word
Make that money Watch it burn
Old but I'm not that old
Young but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
I'm just doing what we're told
And I feel something so wrong
At doing the right thing
I could lie could lie could lie
Everything that drowns me makes me wanna fly
Lately I been I been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby I been I been prayin' hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars
Lately I been I been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby I been I been prayin' hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be we'll be counting stars
Take that money And watch it burn
Sink in the river The lessons I learned
Take that money And watch it burn
Sink in the river The lessons I learned
Take that money And watch it burn
Sink in the river The lessons I learned
Take that money And watch it burn
Sink in the river The lessons I learned
Everything that kills me
makes me feel alive
Lately I been I been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby I been I been prayin' hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars
Lately I been I been losing sleep
